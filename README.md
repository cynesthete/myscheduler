# myscheduler

This scheduler was designed to save the tasks one deems essential on the current day. Specifically, those occurring during the hours of 9 AM and 5 PM. Anything else is off limits. The application designates colors with temporal distinctions: white for past, orange for present, and green for future. This designation should make it easier for the user to assign tasks throughout the day, as well as maximize their time.
